## Overview
This paper discusses a Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) measurement system utilizing a minimal hardware configuration. Thanks to the visual 3D cues displayed by a mixed-reality headset, the subject positions their head in relation to the single loudspeaker following a predefined list of measurement points. During this automated procedure, Head Related Impulse Responses (HRIRs) of the individual are captured at different sound incidence angles. The proposed post-processing of the measured responses is aimed at eliminating the acoustic characteristic of the room where the measurement was taken. A direction-dependent correction filter derived from laboratory measurements is proposed in order to compensate for the influence of the XR headset on HRTFs.
